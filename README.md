# Binding Templates

This is a Haskell program to generate ski binding
mounting templates in SVG given a boot sole length (BSL).

Be on the safe side and treat all templates as unverified:
Test mount your gear on 2x4s and check the mid sole
point for correctness before drilling into skis.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Recommended Tools

- A micro adjust [marking guage](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/marking-and-measuring/marking-gauges/75849-veritas-micro-adjust-wheel-marking-gauge)
  for finding the ski's centerline.
- An [optical center punch](https://www.grizzly.com/products/grizzly-optical-punch-set/h5781)
  for precision drilling.
- A high quality [mini drill press](https://www.grizzly.com/products/grizzly-variable-speed-mini-benchtop-drill-press/t32006)
  for straight, accurate holes.
- A short [5/32" drill bit](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/130/2798/2908A37).
- A [5/32" shaft collar](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/130/1457/9414T4) to set the 9.5mm drilling depth.
- A [tap](https://www.bindingfreedom.com/12ab3-alpine-tap-tin-coated/) for standard alpine binding screws.
- A nice long [tap wrench](https://www.starrett.com/details?cat-no=93E) to ensure good tap alignment.
- A comfy [Pozidriv #3 (PZ3) screwdriver](https://www.hazet.de/en/products/hand-tools/screwdriver-screw-driver-bit/screwdriver/product/ean-4000896145089).
