# Binding Templates

A [Lean](https://lean-lang.org) program to generate ski binding mounting templates in SVG given a boot sole length (BSL).

Browse templates in the [generated-templates](https://github.com/tomahawkins/binding-templates/tree/master/generated-templates) directory above.

Treat all templates as unverified: Test mount your gear on 2x4s and check the mid sole point for correctness before drilling into skis.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
